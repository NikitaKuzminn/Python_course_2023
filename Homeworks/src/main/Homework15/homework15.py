#
# You will work with this endpoint - https://api.punkapi.com/v2/beers/8
#  Need to write 2 tests:
# 1. Using requests method GET need to check that:
# * status code - 200
# * name - Fake Lager
# * abv - 4.7
# 2. Using requests method DELETE need to check that:
# * status code - 404
# * message - No endpoint found that matches '/v2/beers/8'
